Please find the R script file inside, where I worked to prepare on dataset. It's in early stage and the data is yet to be finalisd. 

> Update 1:
- I have to re analyse it as the there are some issues training the data. 

> Update 2:
- I have added the R script file, which contains the updated code, the method I used to prepare my normalised dataset.
- A Matlab file is also included where the code for regression and gradient descent is written. I have not used any libraries yet, though I intend to use them in future for better optimization.
- I will keep working on it to improve my techniques and will try my best to add a Jupyter Notebook in my next update
